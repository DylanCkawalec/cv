# The best low budget podcasting set up

In this article, I show you which tools are absolutley needs and some of the steps nessesary for creating your own podcast. Each section I list tools, and a brief explanation of how the tools piece togetehr with some of my own suggestions of how to best use them. I then explain how to properly present yourself, and how to stylize your podcast. I answer all the questions you didn't think you needed to ask yourself to help you stay on track. In the end, you should have walk away with -- 

- Knowing all the tools and components that make up a podcast
- tips for making your podcast better
- A pretty good idea of how to make a professional podcast on a really low budget. 

# What We need 
**Microphone** : Yetti / Yeticaster, later upgrade to XLR mic that plugs into an audio mixer. The Yeti or Yeticaster microphone and Logitech G Pro headset are both popular choices for podcasting. 

**Headset**: Logitech G Pro, or other gaming headsets from Blue Microphones with USB. 
- If you don't have the necessary audio inputs on your computer, you may need to use an audio interface or sound card to connect your microphone and headset.

**Recording** : audacityteam.org or Adobe Audition and make use of OBS and host through discord for your inputs from guests. Audacity and Adobe Audition are both good options for recording and editing audio
Audio card if you don’t have the plug in’s or hardware required.**OBS** (Open Broadcaster Software) is a popular tool for streaming and recording video, and it can be used to capture audio inputs from guests
- Discord is a popular communication platform that can be used to host your podcast recordings

**FTP location**: Cyberduck, FileZilla
- Cyberduck and FileZilla are both good options for transferring files to and from a server using FTP (File Transfer Protocol).
- (For Better audio, use Shure Mvi
- Recording (media file, RSS and show notes) - Make notes of what to talk about(prep)
---

## Flow of the Sessions
- Create your own "**General sign off**" -- This should be a welcoming intro and Outtro. 
- Always Put your recordings in a computer file storage area.
- Always export to MP3!
- Generate an **RSS** (*really simple syndication*) file which can happen automatically on a blog engine. This is our podcast feed. LibSyn.com and put the file on a web server. We want to generate an **RSS 2.0 file**. We can use Wordpress or LibSyn to do this automatically, or code it ourself using podba.se/validate to create you own RSS tag that you can input into your Media File (this can save cost if done right). The reason why this is important, is because it is this link thats used to have your podcast be posted in many different areas. 
- If you decide to add music, the sound must adjusted to be  -11.0 ~ -16.0 **db**
- Make a show note script to grab your audiences attention.
- **Podcasting stations** : Spotify, Apple, stitcher, overcast.fm, riverside.fm, Google Play Music Store. 

    ## The RSS feed is for multiplatform adoption
    > To create an RSS feed for the podcast, we will need to include information such as the **title, description, and file location** of each episode. This can be done manually using a tool like podba.se/validate, or automatically using a blogging platform like **WordPress** or a hosting service like **LibSyn**.
    > 
    > If you we **adding music** to your podcast, it's important to adjust the volume of the music so that it doesn't overpower the voice of your speakers. A good rule of thumb is to reduce the volume of the music to -11 to -16 dB.
    > 
    > Show notes are a **summary of the content** of your podcast episode, along with any relevant links or resources. They can be used to give listeners a preview of what to expect in the episode, and to make it easier for them to follow along or find additional information.
    > 
    > There are many **platforms** where you can distribute your podcast, including Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, Overcast, Google Play Music, and many others. Each platform has its own requirements for submitting a podcast, so be sure to read their guidelines carefully before uploading your episodes.
    
# How to have on multiple guests
###### **tools**
- **Mixer** : **Behringer Q1202USB** - USB and 4 mic for $150
- **Goal**: Get several mics to do independent audio flow into audacity through the mixing board interface.
    - We’ll want to **test Audacity input, using OBS and with a Guest speaking over either Zoom or Discord to capture their audio**. We will then take out the audio and amplify it to make a proper mix of the entire recording and edit the content in Audacity and final cut pro in Adobe to make the final edit. Compress the file and then use podba.se to get the RSS finished and post somewhere.
    - Combo is the **Rodecaster Pro** which is your mixer, soundboard, recorder, headphone amp and USB for Zoom, Skype or audacity input. this will cost roughly ~ **$600**

###### Explanation
**The Behringer Q1202USB is a good choice for this purpose, as it has 4 mic inputs and a USB output that can be connected to a computer for recording in software like Audacity. OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) can be used to capture audio from a guest speaking over a platform like Zoom or Discord, and the audio can then be edited and mixed in a software like Audacity or Adobe Audition. Final Cut Pro is a video editing software, so it may not be necessary for your podcast if you are only recording audio. After editing and mixing the audio, you can use a tool like podba.se to create an RSS feed for your podcast and distribute it on your chosen platforms. The Rodecaster Pro is another option for a multi-guest podcast recording setup, as it combines a mixer, soundboard, recorder, and headphone amp in one unit. It also has a USB output that can be used to record in software like Audacity or to connect to platforms like Zoom or Skype.**

## **Remember**, Presence is everything

> **Identify your Audience**, Study other podcasts, pick topics we know best, speak confidently. Speak Rhythmically, clearly and with personality. Have a director, give air time, give guests a majority of the time, orient the guest so they know what to expect, and make the visual set up clear. Shorter can be a lot better, but anything beyond 30 minutes is loose. Other than that, **stay on target**.
> 
> It's important to carefully consider your audience when creating a podcast, as this will help you choose topics that will be of interest to them and craft your content in a way that speaks to them directly. **Studying other podcasts** in your niche can give you a sense of what works and what doesn't, and can help you identify opportunities to differentiate your own podcast. 
> 
> **Choosing topics that you are knowledgeable about** and passionate about will make it easier for you to speak confidently and with personality. It's also important to speak rhythmically and clearly, as this will make it easier for your listeners to follow along. **Having a director** can be helpful to keep things on track, and giving your guests a majority of the time can make for a more engaging and dynamic conversation. 
> 
> Finally, it's important to make the visual set up clear, especially if you are using video, as this will help your listeners stay oriented and engaged. In general, shorter podcasts can be more focused and easier to digest, but it's also important to give yourself enough time to delve into your chosen topic in depth.
   
### Adding Artwork for the Show
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJzDeieoj.jpg)

###### **tools**
1. You will need a **.png** /  **RGB mode** / **72 dpi** / **1400 X 1400** or 3000 X 3000 pixels. 
    - Use a .png file format, as this will give you a high-quality image with transparent backgrounds.
    - Use RGB color mode, as this is the most widely used color mode for digital displays.
    - Use a resolution of 72 dpi (dots per inch), as this is the standard resolution for web images.
    - Use a size of 1400 x 1400 pixels or 3000 x 3000 pixels. This will give you a large enough image to display well on a variety of devices.

2. Upload to **LibSyn, cyberduck or Fetch (webserver)**; pull up the artwork on browser and copy the URL. Wordpress offers the powerPress podcast plugin from bluBerry where you enter the URL and can display the image. (**Misu_Ep121_20230107.mp3**)
    - Use a file naming convention that includes the episode number and date, such as "Misu_Ep121_20230107.mp3". This will help you keep track of your episodes and avoid confusion.

    - To display the cover art on your podcast, you can use a plugin like PowerPress on WordPress, or you can use a hosting service like LibSyn or Cyberduck to upload the image and copy the URL. Then, you can enter the URL in the appropriate field on your podcasting platform to display the cover art.

##### **Answering the Questions**
1. If you compress a video file or podcast, you can use a tool like podba.se to generate an RSS feed from it. The RSS feed will typically include information such as the title, description, and file location of your episode.

2. The RSS feed is typically created from the audio file, although it can also include information about the video
3. if the podcast is a video podcast. Pre-compressing the entire video or audio file should not corrupt the RSS feed, as long as the file is still in a supported format (such as MP3 or MP4) and is properly linked in the RSS feed.
4. You can use FTP (File Transfer Protocol) or a decentralized protocol like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to upload your podcast files to a server. FTP requires an IP address, login name, and password, while IPFS uses a unique hash to identify each file.
5. There are pros and cons to both LibSyn and WordPress as podcast hosting platforms. LibSyn is a specialized podcast hosting service that offers a range of features and tools specifically designed for podcasts, while WordPress is a general-purpose blogging platform that has a range of plugins and integrations for podcasting. It's up to you to decide which platform is the best fit for your needs.
6. Whether or not to have sponsors and backlinks is a personal decision that depends on your goals and priorities for your podcast. Sponsors and backlinks can provide financial support and exposure for your podcast, but they can also add complexity and require additional work to maintain.
