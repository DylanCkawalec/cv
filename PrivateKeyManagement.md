   •	Open Terminal. Navigate to Finder > Utilities and click on the Terminal app. You can also press Cmd + Space bar to activate Spotlight search and type 'Terminal.'
	•	Set the directory. The next step is to set the destination of the files that you want to zip and password-protect. Type 'cd' and the location of the file or folder that you want to compress and encrypt. Type' cd downloads' if the file you're looking to compress is saved in the Downloads folder.
	•	Compress and encrypt. Enter the command 'zip -er FILENAME.zip' without the quotes and replace FILENAME with what you want to name your encrypted zip file. Add a space and drag the file/folder to the Terminal window, and press Return.
	•	Enter password. At this point, assuming everything's done right, you'll be prompted to enter and verify the password. Type the password you want to use and hit Return twice. Note that you won't see any characters on the command line when typing your password.
