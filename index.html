      <h2>&#x1F4BB; Notable Projects</h2>
      <div class="experience-item">
        <h3>Invo SDK - Rocky Road API (v3.3.6)</h3>
        <p>
            Developed an architecture that allows games and their players to use a decentralized exchange within the game. This enables interoperability of game tokens across different games. I employed advanced encryption techniques such as AEAD, AES, and RSA, and managed keys using BIP39 and HKDF. The robust backend was built using Actix Web and integrated with various Rust libraries. For instance, Redis was used for efficient data processing and storage, facilitating communication between games and our Invo parachain using Substrate's subxt library.
        </p>
      </div>
    

      <div class="experience-item">
        <h3>B3zrk (v0.4.0)</h3>
        <p>
          Created an off-chain cryptocurrency exchange system using Rust, leveraging the Blake3 hashing algorithm for efficient and secure data processing. Invented and utilized the POEMS protocol as a zero-knowledge Trusted Execution Environment to verify function signatures securely and correctly. Computed off-chain decentralized exchange transactions as verifiable on-chain exchange executions by leveraging Aleo to produce ZKPs with Poseidon2, BHP256, SHA3, and Keccak256 signature schemes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="experience-item">
        <h3>Invo AI (v0.2.0)</h3>
        <p>
          Developed a blockchain relayer using Rust, designed to act as an AI data analyst for the Invo blockchain. Leveraged the Actix Web framework to build scalable and performant web services. Integrated with external AI APIs using Reqwest for intelligent data processing and analysis. Utilized Serde for efficient data serialization and deserialization, enabling seamless communication between different components of the system.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="experience-item">
        <h3>POEMS Protocol</h3>
        <p>
          Invented the POEMS protocol, a zero-knowledge Trusted Execution Environment for verifying function signatures securely and correctly. Received a grant of $50,000 from the Aleo Foundation to architect and develop the protocol. Leveraged the protocol to compute off-chain decentralized exchange transactions as verifiable on-chain exchange executions, enhancing privacy and scalability.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="experience-item">
        <h3>Invo Wallet Interface (v0.1.0)</h3>
        <p>
          Built a secure and user-friendly wallet interface using Rust, incorporating advanced cryptographic techniques like HMAC, HKDF, and elliptic curve cryptography. Implemented support for BIP39 mnemonic phrases and utilized the Tiny-Keccak library for efficient hash calculations. Integrated with the Substrate blockchain framework using the sp-core library, enabling seamless interaction with blockchain networks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="experience-item">
        <h3>AIMBC Trustless Bridge Protocol</h3>
        <p>
            Developed the AIMBC trustless bridge protocol using Solidity. This protocol allows secure and efficient token swaps across different EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchains. I used the Aleo blockchain to generate zero-knowledge proofs, which verify transactions and ensure trustless execution of Atomic Swaps that function similarly to a bridging protocol. The design was inspired by the HTLC (Hashed TimeLock Contract) protocol. I integrated this with the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain using the Rust ethers-rs library, which enables seamless interoperability and liquidity provision.
