    <!-- Professional Summary -->
    <section>
      <h2><span class="icon">&#x1F464;</span> Professional Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I've dedicated my career to building privacy-preserving systems with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Over the past 5+ years, I've worked on confidential AI, secure blockchain infrastructure, and privacy tools across Ethereum, Bitcoin L2s, Cosmos, and Polkadot.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Phala Network, where I was Head of Developer Relations, I helped launch some of the earliest confidential AI agents that run fully encrypted on-chain, built TEE-based private compute to keep models and data protected end-to-end, and worked on partnerships that brought these tools into web2 and web3 projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also contributed to two filed patents on zero-trust systems for running protected code in TEEs—using lattice-based hashing, fully homomorphic encryption, and ZKPs to enable verifiable computation without exposing any sensitive data.
      </p>
      <p>
        While at Invo Technologies (as former CTO), I built privacy-preserving in-game currency exchange systems on Substrate that securely funded wallets and handled decentralized swap routing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I helped ship a fully private EVM stack at Discreet Labs/Findora for confidential transactions, and created a decentralized frontend framework for Osmosis that stays credibly neutral (using dstack) and performs well at the edge.
