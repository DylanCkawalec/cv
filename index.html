    <!-- Professional Summary -->
    <section>
      <h2><span class="icon">&#x1F464;</span> Professional Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a blockchain solutions architect and principal software engineer who thrives at the intersection of cryptography and distributed systems. My journey began building full-stack web applications, which led me to embrace blockchain for its transformative potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a CTO, I designed a decentralized game currency exchange with cryptographically secure payment channels. I've architected institutional-grade custody solutions using quantum-resistant MPC and TEEs, and led developer adoption for Layer 2 and smart contract platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        In roles spanning Head of Developer Relations, R&D Engineer, and Principal Software Engineer, I've scaled products, mentored teams, and shaped ecosystems across Ethereum, Bitcoin Layer 2, Cosmos, and beyond. I blend deep research in zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption with practical software delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's collaborate to push the boundaries of secure, decentralized innovation—where my expertise in translating advanced research into robust production systems can drive real impact.
