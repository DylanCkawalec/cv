# Guidelines for Developers on bounties

## 1 - Content of Bounties

### 1.1 Purpose of Bounty
- We will actively seek out and engage external developers who possess the necessary coding experience and skill sets to contribute to the BNB Ecosystem.

- We will offer rewards, and incentives to attract top talent in the developer community. 

- We will strive to consistently demonstrate our technical prowess, product focus, and decentralized approach through our actions and interactions with the developer community. This includes transparent communication, collaboration, and openness to feedback, as well as regularly sharing updates on our progress and achievements.

### 1.2 Category of Bounty 
#### 1.2.1 internal bounties 

##### BSC Node [https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc]
These bounties will likely be offered by BNB's core team of engineers.
- Addressing key issues such as scalability, security, interoperability, consensus mechanism, high traffic handling, and user experience. Developers will be given necessary materials including documentation, test cases to understand and provide solutions by core engineers. 

##### Internal Services 
We would like to see proposals be made to enhance user experience for our existing chains & infestructure. 
- [BSC Explorer improvements]([https://](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc-explorer/issues))
- [zkBNB API Performance upgrades](https://github.com/bnb-chain/zkbnb-eth-rpc)
  
##### Toolings
We'd like to add additional tools to our repository
- [Beacon Chain  #1 - Software Development Kits](https://github.com/bnb-chain/javascript-sdk)
- [Token Binding ](https://github.com/bnb-chain/token-bind-tool)
- [Truffle Box](https://github.com/bnb-chain/BSC-Truffle-Starter-Box)

## 2 - What makes a "Good Bounty"

### 2.1 making a good bounty
When creating bounties, it is important to consider the following guidelines:

Bounties should be self-contained, meaning they should be able to be completed independently without the need for additional support or resources.

The project description should be clear and concise, with no ambiguity. Engineers prefer well-defined starting and ending points, and it is helpful to provide engineering documentation to assist them.

Acceptance criteria should be clearly defined and strict. The more detailed the criteria, the more satisfied engineers will be. Providing test scenarios can help with this.

Bounties should not include business operations or long-term development support. They should be simple and straightforward for programmers.

The size of the bounty is not a key factor in determining its quality. Bounties can be small or large, but it is recommended that they be around 1-6 human weeks in length.

Developers will have the flexibility to contribute to a single project or work on multiple projects.

Developers may not have prior knowledge to Harmony blockchain, but that shouldn't be a problem.

Bounties are for developers who can work alone to complete them.

If a bounty cannot be self-contained, provide a clean scope with lesser boundaries.

Sometimes this can be compromised through clean writing and some helpful conversation at the bootstrap.

### Writting a good Bounty

**To write a good bounty, it is important to include the following four fields:**  [ISSUE_TEMPLATE]()

1. Description: This field should provide a clear and concise overview of the problem or task that needs to be completed. It should also include any necessary background information or context.

2. Context (Optional): This field is optional but it could be useful in case the developer needs more information about the background, the reason why the bounty is being launched, or any other context that would be useful for the developer.

3. Acceptance Criteria: This field should detail what needs to be done in order to complete the bounty and what constitutes success. It should be specific, measurable, and clear.

4. Reward: This field should specify the reward that will be given to the developer upon successful completion of the bounty. It should be clear, fair and motivating for the developer.

> By providing a clear and well-defined description, context, acceptance criteria, and reward, developers will have a better understanding of the task at hand and will be better equipped to complete the bounty successfully.
