- [resources]()


| Challenge name | Objective | Challenge |  Problem  |
| --------       | --------  | --------  |   ------- |
|  **File Sharing** | End-to-End Encryption method for clients. |Perform E2E using BEP721 Metadata. Clients should be able to share encrypted metadata and transact ownership of this data in a full anonymous fashion. | Generate a scenario using SW3|
| **R&D**  |Provide Model’s as a Service applications that can be serviceable by data providers.|Generate a basic (MaaS) product or service live on BSC Mainnet.|Please make a strong and convincing argument for Regenerative Finance. Your solution should focus on Project Greenfield’s technical strengths and limitations with ways to further improve the protocol. |
| **zkStorage** |Verify off-chain data for use on chain.|Calculate commitments off chain and synchronize read & write data.|You should create a Low Level API that makes data readily available to clients. |
| **Data Availability** |Implement zkBNB as a “model as a service” to transact tokens using AWS/SW3|Create an SDK that explains how to service private dApp’s without using IPFS or SWARM. All data should come from a single server. The dApp should be used to manage single transfers using zkBNB.|Your solution should make use of gRPC’s and implement a micro-service architecture using Kubernetes & Docker. |
