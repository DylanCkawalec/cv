# Issues are Bounties 
At BNB, our motto is 'Build and Build.' We firmly believe in the power of active development and growth to drive progress forward. That's why we're giving developers the opportunity to commit to their own issues raised on our Github repository - to foster a community of builders and creators who can push the BNB ecosystem forward together.

# Bounty Introduction
**Creating Bounties**: Anyone can start a bounty in this repository by offering token rewards to those who complete it according to the specified guidelines. To get started, follow the instructions in the `Read-This-Program` file, and use the `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` to create your own bounty.

Please read carefully through the guidelines to get a complete understanding of how bountys are created and discovered. Please provide feedback on our [forum](https://forum.bnbchain.org/) if you would like to suggest a stronger way to manage our bounty initiative. 
## How to participate 
**Steps to Participate in Bounties:**

- Binancians and the development community can submit bounties by creating a new `issue` on this repository.

- After an `issue` is created, anyone can commit to the bounty and become a 'Bounty Hunter.'

- **Bounty Hunters** will provide a proposal on the `issue` commenting section, describing how they plan to complete the bounty and wait for the approval of the **bounty issuer**. They can also contact the bounty issuer directly (the person who posted the bounty).

- A clearly defined acceptance criteria will benefit both producers and hunters in achieving successful bounties. providing more details will help bounty hunters understand the expectations and requirements of the bounty and ensure that the work done meets those expectations.
